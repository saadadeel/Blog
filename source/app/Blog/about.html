				3D fold effects are pretty popular nowadays, mostly because they have been integrated quite often in mobile apps. A beautiful example is the iOS Peek Calendar app. Thanks to CSS3 transformation and transitions, we can create a similar interaction in the browser!

				Sometimes these 3D effects feel too strong, unnecessary. It’s a point I can’t argue with. However, there will be cases when you need to load content, a process that requires time (even if it’s just half a second). In these cases an animation can be a nice way to replace a loading bar, or a loading gif. Besides, with the growth of native apps built on top of web frameworks, learning how to create complex CSS transformations is an ace up your sleeve.
