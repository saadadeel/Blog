			Took me a while to complete this project, not because it was complex but because it went throught so many iterations. From having the nav on the side to even having a twitter feed on the blogs page, wish there was someone to impose a deadline for me. It was made using Vanilla Javascript and grunt as the build tool. As mentioned before the development process of this blog took a few detours which allowed me explore node.js, express, and socket.io, which I do not regret. At some point I will put my code on github for all programmers to ridicule.
		</p>
		<p>
			So what is this blog for. Just a place for me to ramble about things I come across I guess, could be technichal or otherwise. Could be anything from a movie review to an article about why I like to use REMs insteasd of pixels. I would also like to use this place to give updates on projects I am working on. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I would like to add a home page for this website soon, also maybe some filters for the blog page and also a projects page. If this site somehow through some miracle starts getting some attention I might even add the ability for users to add comments to my posts.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cool, lets see where this blog goes.

			3D fold effects are pretty popular nowadays, mostly because they have been integrated quite often in mobile apps. A beautiful example is the iOS Peek Calendar app. Thanks to CSS3 transformation and transitions, we can create a similar interaction in the browser!
		</p>
			Sometimes these 3D effects feel too strong, unnecessary. It’s a point I can’t argue with. However, there will be cases when you need to load content, a process that requires time (even if it’s just half a second). In these cases an animation can be a nice way to replace a loading bar, or a loading gif. Besides, with the growth of native apps built on top of web frameworks, learning how to create complex CSS transformations is an ace up your sleeve.
		<p>
			To realise our animation, we used CSS3 Transformations applied to the .left-fold, .right-fold, .cd-main and .cd-item elements.
		</p>
			The 2 folds are created animating the ::after pseudo-elements of the .left-fold and .right-fold.
		<p>
			On mobile, we animate only the right fold (.left-fold element has a display: none): by default, the .cd-folding-panel (and its child .right-panel) has a position fixed and covers the entire viewport (but its visibility is set to hidden), while the .right-panel::after is translated to the left and rotated (translateX(-100%)  rotateY(-90deg), with transform-origin: right center).
		</p>
		<p>
			When user clicks one of the .cd-item, the .cd-main content is translated to the right (using the .fold-is-open class), while the .right-fold::after is 	translated into the viewport and rotated back (using the .is-open class assigned to the .cd-folding-panel).

			On desktop devices (viewport width > 1100px), both ::after pseudo-elements are animated: the .cd-folding-panel is now placed in the center of the viewport (width: 800px), the .left-panel and .right-panel have a float: left and width equal to half of their parent (400px). Their ::after pseudo-elements are both rotated (rotateY(-90deg)) and translated to the left (.left-panel::after – translateX(100%)) or to the right (.right-panel::after – translateX(-100%)).
			When user clicks one of the .cd-item, they are translated to the left (:nth-of-type(2n+1)) or to the right (:nth-of-type(2n)), while both ::after pseudo-elements are translated and rotated back (rotateY(0) translateX(0)).
