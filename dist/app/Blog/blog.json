From having the nav on the side to even having a twitter feed on the blogs page, wish there was someone to impose a deadline for me. It was made using Vanilla Javascript and grunt as the build tool. As mentioned before the development process of this blog took a few detours which allowed me explore node.js, express, and socket.io, which I do not regret. At some point I will put my code on github for all programmers to ridicule.</p><p>So what is this blog for. Just a place for me to ramble about things I come across I guess, could be technichal or otherwise. Could be anything from a movie review to an article about why I like to use REMs insteasd of pixels. I would also like to use this place to give updates on projects I am working on. </p><p>I would like to add a home page for this website soon, also maybe some filters for the blog page and also a projects page. If this site somehow through some miracle starts getting some attention I might even add the ability for users to add comments to my posts.</p><p>Cool, lets see where this blog goes.</p></div>",
